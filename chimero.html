    	<h1>Church Going</h1>
    	
    	<p>Once I am sure there's nothing going on<br />
			I step inside, letting the door thud shut.<br />
			Another church: matting, seats, and stone,<br />
			And little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut<br />
			For Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff<br />
			Up at the holy end; the small neat organ;<br />
			And a tense, musty, unignorable silence,<br />
			Brewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off<br />
			My cycle-clips in awkward reverence.</p>

		<p>Move forward, run my hand around the font.<br />
		From where I stand, the roof looks almost new -<br />
		Cleaned, or restored? Someone would know: I don't.<br />
		Mounting the lectern, I peruse a few<br />
		Hectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce<br />
		'Here endeth' much more loudly than I'd meant.<br />
		The echoes snigger briefly. Back at the door<br />
		I sign the book, donate an Irish sixpence,<br />
		Reflect the place was not worth stopping for.</p>

		<p>Yet stop I did: in fact I often do,<br />
		And always end much at a loss like this,<br />
		Wondering what to look for; wondering, too,<br />
		When churches will fall completely out of use<br />
		What we shall turn them into, if we shall keep<br />
		A few cathedrals chronically on show,<br />
		Their parchment, plate and pyx in locked cases,<br />
		And let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.<br />
		Shall we avoid them as unlucky places?</p>

		<p>Or, after dark, will dubious women come<br />
		To make their children touch a particular stone;<br />
		Pick simples for a cancer; or on some<br />
		Advised night see walking a dead one?<br />
		Power of some sort will go on<br />
		In games, in riddles, seemingly at random;<br />
		But superstition, like belief, must die,<br />
		And what remains when disbelief has gone?<br />
		Grass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,</p>

		<p>A shape less recognisable each week,<br />
		A purpose more obscure. I wonder who<br />
		Will be the last, the very last, to seek<br />
		This place for what it was; one of the crew<br />
		That tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were?<br />
		Some ruin-bibber, randy for antique,<br />
		Or Christmas-addict, counting on a whiff<br />
		Of gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh?<br />
		Or will he be my representative,</p>

		<p>Bored, uninformed, knowing the ghostly silt<br />
		Dispersed, yet tending to this cross of ground<br />
		Through suburb scrub because it held unspilt<br />
		So long and equably what since is found<br />
		Only in separation - marriage, and birth,<br />
		And death, and thoughts of these - for which was built<br />
		This special shell? For, though I've no idea<br />
		What this accoutred frowsty barn is worth,<br />
		It pleases me to stand in silence here;</p>

		<p>A serious house on serious earth it is,<br />
		In whose blent air all our compulsions meet,<br />
		Are recognized, and robed as destinies.<br />
		And that much never can be obsolete,<br />
		Since someone will forever be surprising<br />
		A hunger in himself to be more serious,<br />
		And gravitating with it to this ground,<br />
		Which, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,<br />
		If only that so many dead lie round.</p>
